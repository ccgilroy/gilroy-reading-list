## Reorganization

Practices and identity are more central to the "how" of community; to inclusion and belonging.

Geography and technology are things that moderate or mediate it.

Need to merge the sections on exclusion, power, and (political) consequences, maybe.

This reframes what's central and what's peripheral in the exam.

I started with 5 sections. Merged into 3:

- inclusions + exclusions; two sides of same process
- changes + consequences; bc interested in consequences of *change*

the technology stuff fits into the section on change pretty well. urban stuff is a little more ambiguous---could go into practices, or into changes.
