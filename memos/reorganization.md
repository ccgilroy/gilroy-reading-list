## Reorganization

Practices and identity are more central to the "how" of community; to inclusion and belonging.

Geography and technology are things that moderate or mediate it.

Need to merge the sections on exclusion, power, and (political) consequences, maybe.

This reframes what's central and what's peripheral in the exam.
