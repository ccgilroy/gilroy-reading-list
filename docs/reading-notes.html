<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> introductions</h3>
<p>[NB: editor Jose Harris is a woman, and I think her name is pronounced “Josie” not “José”]</p>
<p>This edition is less about sociology than about political theory, but I think that’s okay if it’s a good critical translation. It isn’t the classic translation that would have informed 20c sociology.</p>
<p>All the talk of Hobbes is giving me flashbacks.</p>
<p>A lot of Tönnies is about different forms of property and law. [Do queer communities lack a political economy? Property, industrial base, etc…? Reminds me of the position of women in society, more than of people of color. Ani DiFranco: “Who says I like right angles?”]</p>
<p>tried to be analytical, not normative, but I sense skepticism from the editor.</p>
<p>Original English translation by Charles Loomis was the foundational one for US sociology</p>
<p>Maybe read Parsons’ Note on Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft</p>
<p>relative pronouns are much more confusing in English than German, probs even more so than French</p>
<p>nice discussion of terminology and translation</p>
</div>
<div id="main-text" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> main text</h3>
<p>[7] scientific thinking, calculating, measurement, identity, prototypes, names + numbers</p>
<p>I feel like the Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft is less clear cut than it sounds on [18]: certain things seem like they could be either depending on how you look at them or experience them. Queer communities, academic communities. (Also, no one talks about queer societies in English, anyway…)</p>
<p>Starts Gemeinschaft with (heteronormative) kinship [22] (but queer folk use the same language of kinship for reasons); note that he almost immediately talks about (gendered) power, inequality, authority [23-25]; power and protection [27];</p>
<p>blood -&gt; place -&gt; spirit = kinship -&gt; neighborhood -&gt; friend/comradeship; home -&gt; village -&gt; town [27-29] [think about this more] [why are gayborhoods so often called villages? maybe because queer worlds are small worlds]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherever human beings are bound together in an organic fashion by their inclination and common consent, Community of one kind or another exists. [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>how community can generate inequality [32]; language, will, understanding, and love -&gt; “the fundamental laws of all community”, <em>concord</em> [33-4]; [I hear echoes of Saussure in this section; the various editions of this book would’ve evolved in parallel with CLG]; ties to Anderson in the next.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A whole town, or a village, or a nation, a tribe, a clan and finally a family can all in the same way been seen and understood as a particular type of guild or religious community. And vice versa—all these many different structures and formations are contained within the idea of the family and all proceed from it as the universal expression of the reality of Community. [36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>translator’s footnote on Stadt vs Großstadt; also this: “And we forget that living together is a primal fact of nature; it is isolation, not co-operation, that needs to be explained.” [38]; [this section is about property / in-common]; gets to households, is probably going to say things I disagree with. I don’t think Jane Jacobs would agree with him about who has the advantage in relationship between town and country [42]; feudal relationships aren’t contracts, but understandings [46]; religious/economic/artistic/political integration of the city</p>
<p>Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft: unity/detachment [52]; [again, these are ideal types, operating simultaneously]; commentary on preferences/values;</p>

<div id="anderson-1983-imagined-communities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Anderson 1983, <em>Imagined Communities</em></h2>
<p>Is “community” itself a concept bounded by language/nation? Anderson talks about the difficulty of finding a similarly warm and fuzzy word in French, and argues that English community has more in common with German Gemeinschaft than Latin communitas. I know that in France, <em>communautarisme</em> is a bad thing, and as something imported from the US. (I should read more about this, both in terms of ethnicity and in terms of sexuality.)</p>
<p>At the same time, one of his key examples is of national communities in Latin America. So, how does communidad <em>feel</em> in Spanish? My personal hunch is that it does exist as a meaningful word with positive connotations. But, I could be thinking primarily of latinx communities in the US, whose political understandings of community are inflected by English.</p>

<div id="collins-2010-the-new-politics-of-community" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Collins 2010, “The New Politics of Community”</h2>
<p>[this was the 2009 ASA presidential address. it’s useful because it’s an opinionated take on the state of a particular facet of the discipline. it happens to be one that resonates strongly with me.]</p>
<p>links “community” to power relations, which are about knowledge and culture, symbol and structure</p>
<p>link to Jennifer Nash: discussion of political love</p>
<p>Tönnies: family, community, love</p>
<p>idea of community used to reinforce and challenge social inequalities</p>
<p>analogy with feminist politicization of the family</p>
<p>the construct of community is neglected <em>because</em> associated with women, ethnic groups, religious minorities, etc</p>
<p>why community?</p>
<ul>
<li>language of community is ubiquitous in US; often associated with place, neighborhood</li>
<li>versatile, malleable, easy to use, but taken-for-granted</li>
<li>varied/contradictory meanings &amp; practices</li>
<li>strong feeling, motivator for action</li>
<li>matters to everyday experience of social inequalities</li>
</ul>
<p>[I like <em>community</em> because it brings together place, culture, networks. PHC is adding power to that mix (kind of like Talja Blokland).]</p>
<p>[Should I read Du Bois, The Philadelphia Negro, as a classic community study?]</p>
<p>communities as political projects (discusses five sites, with criteria)</p>
<ul>
<li>gated communities (real/metaphor, public/private): boundary work</li>
<li>grassroots politics (language of community)</li>
<li><p>imagined communities (nations, beyond face-to-face, mediation—and its consequences for the powerful center)</p>
<ul>
<li>bottom-up public sphere? [she’s still optimistic, but this was 2009];</li>
<li>beyond geography?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is key, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When reframed through power relations, imagined communities can be marshaled for oppressive or emancipatory political projects.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>community service (military vs care work)</li>
<li><p>community organizing (identity and affinity politics; she’s not into this binary; links it to community vs civil society)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>again, “intersecting systems of power relations”; community for relational thinking (contrasted to binary thinking in use of categories); helpful for thinking social change &amp; reconfigurations of social space (“In a situation of fluidity and seeming interdependence, who knows who belongs where?”), in context of flexibility and ambiguity (<em>because</em> the concept is flexible); symbolic boundary construction; key: community can do both, it’s not inherently emancipatory or oppressive; community and democracy/egalitarianism? (US pragmatist tradition, including Du Bois)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nineteenth-century African American journalist Ida Wells-Barnett’s anti-lynching crusade illustrates the effectiveness of joining an unshakable commitment to community with a passion for social justice.
…
Black people were not her mass, her mob, her public, her population, or a statistical collection of potential lynching victims—they were her community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnotes situate her in the sociological conversation about community and make her methods and epistemologies more explicit.</p>
<p>[do I like communities because they’re a meso-level social construct? PHC says they link individuals to social institutions]</p>
<p>[she applies community to sociology as a discipline in a really reflexive and insightful way]</p>
<p>[this piece makes it obvious how useful sociology of culture is: meanings, boundaries, categories, relational thinking…]</p>
<p>[Nathan Jurgenson was one of her RAs]</p>
