What are the social processes by which a sense of community is created, sustained, or lost? Namely, how do network structures and cultural meanings interact to produce and reproduce bounded social groups to which individuals can perceive and feel that they belong? Scale, geography, technology. How does scale, from local to global, shape the experience of or even possibility for community? What’s the continued salience of physical space for shaping local difference, against the ability of technology to homogenize and unify at bigger scales? Practice, interaction, identity. What kinds of micro-level, interactional practices work to create community? When do social identity categories become salient axes for organizing communities? How do ordinary people and researchers understand these different identities operating simultaneously—as analogous, competing, or intersecting? Power, visibility, stigma. How do different communities interact, especially across differentials of power? How do they maintain distinctions, or merge? Specifically, what role do visibility and stigma play in the marginalization and stratification of minority groups? Consequences. What does community do for people? Does it provide a motivation for participation in social action, and meaningful objects for people to attach to—for instance, a reason to care about the fates of some places and not others? It’s typically conceived as bottom-up and organic—when and how is it coopted, by formal organizations, corporations, or the state? 1.2 Sample readings 1.2.1 Structure, culture, reproduction Lizardo, Omar. 2006. “How Cultural Tastes Shape Personal Networks.” American Sociological Review 71(5):778–807.
