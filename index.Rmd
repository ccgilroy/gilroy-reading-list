# Introduction {-}

This is the reading list for my [PhD comprehensive exam](https://soc.washington.edu/phd-comprehensive-exam) in Sociology at the University of Washington.

The reading list is hosted online at https://ccgilroy.github.io/gilroy-reading-list/. It was created using the [**bookdown**](https://bookdown.org/) R package.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
