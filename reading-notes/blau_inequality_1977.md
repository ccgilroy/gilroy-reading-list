## Blau 1977, *Inequality and Heterogeneity*

in the preface, he's clear about his axioms and assumptions; sort of a statement of positionality. "Strong ingroup bonds do not appeal to me personally, inasmuch as I think of them as expressions of ethnocentrism..." and he thinks of them as an obstacle to integration (They appeal to me, though)

I need to know his definition of structure and decide on my opinion on it. My hunch is I agree more with Lévi-Strauss

argues that even simple societies have multiple positions; vs Durkheim who focuses on their similarity (and more like Tönnies in a way)

population is also fundamental to his definition

what do coherence and integration mean? implicitly they're positive

coming out is definitely a change in social position.

argues that if an attribute doesn't have an effect on social associations, it isn't relevant for social life. that might be extreme. (what about health disparities, for example? dying early doesn't shape who you interact with, for the most part, but does shape life chances). though i'd accept that such an attribute isn't a structural parameter.

huge focus on distributions of variables, because that's distinctive about (structural) sociology

nominal, graduated. (what about Fourcade on ordinalization?)

groups for him are just nominal categories, BUT only those that influence role relations. ranked characteristics are status. argument is that ingroup (=within category) relations are more prevalent. (vs zero-blocks?)

heterogeneity is horizontal differentiation, inequality is vertical differentiation. [compare to Gayle Rubin's view of variation and her charmed circle!]

inequality vs status diversity (Simmel's paradox of inequality)

def integration [11]; opposite of differentiation; implication that it's good, that cohesion is good.

can we really bracket content? my example would be race: the history of race in the US---specifically the fact of slavery---means that the distribution of Black people is geographically concentrated, which affects possibilities for social interaction. It's hard to account for that without dealing with Blackness specifically. In other words, talking about "ingroup preferences" elides racism, discrimination.

treats communities as "hav[ing] social structures which constitute substructures of society's structure" [13]. Maybe I'm just projecting Centola backward, but it feels to me like he takes groupness and the cultural construction of groups for granted. *How* is it that some categories affect social relations, and others don't?

need nominal parameters for boundaries, and hence for substructures [16]

he's more in line with British structural anthropologists than French structuralists; doesn't care about culture, values, symbols [16]. more in line with Durkheim's division of labor, not study of religion. [maybe in part because he agrees with Parsons' take on EFRL?]

chapter 7 is gonna be important
