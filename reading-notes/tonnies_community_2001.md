## Tönnies 1887, *Community and Civil Society*

### introductions

[NB: editor Jose Harris is a woman, and I think her name is pronounced "Josie" not "José"]

This edition is less about sociology than about political theory, but I think that's okay if it's a good critical translation. It isn't the classic translation that would have informed 20c sociology.

All the talk of Hobbes is giving me flashbacks.

A lot of Tönnies is about different forms of property and law. [Do queer communities lack a political economy? Property, industrial base, etc...? Reminds me of the position of women in society, more than of people of color. Ani DiFranco: "Who says I like right angles?"]

tried to be analytical, not normative, but I sense skepticism from the editor.

Original English translation by Charles Loomis was the foundational one for US sociology

Maybe read Parsons' Note on Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft

relative pronouns are much more confusing in English than German, probs even more so than French

nice discussion of terminology and translation

### main text

#### Part 1

[7] scientific thinking, calculating, measurement, identity, prototypes, names + numbers

I feel like the Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft is less clear cut than it sounds on [18]: certain things seem like they could be either depending on how you look at them or experience them. Queer communities, academic communities. (Also, no one talks about queer societies in English, anyway...)

Starts Gemeinschaft with (heteronormative) kinship [22] (but queer folk use the same language of kinship for reasons); note that he almost immediately talks about (gendered) power, inequality, authority [23-25]; power and protection [27];

blood -> place -> spirit = kinship -> neighborhood -> friend/comradeship; home -> village -> town [27-29] [think about this more] [why are gayborhoods so often called villages? maybe because queer worlds are small worlds]

> Wherever human beings are bound together in an organic fashion by their inclination and common consent, Community of one kind or another exists. [28]

how community can generate inequality [32]; language, will, understanding, and love -> "the fundamental laws of all community", *concord* [33-4]; [I hear echoes of Saussure in this section; the various editions of this book would've evolved in parallel with CLG]; ties to Anderson in the next.

> A whole town, or a village, or a nation, a tribe, a clan and finally a family can all in the same way been seen and understood as a particular type of guild or religious community. And vice versa---all these many different structures and formations are contained within the idea of the family and all proceed from it as the universal expression of the reality of Community. [36]

translator's footnote on Stadt vs Großstadt; also this: "And we forget that living together is a primal fact of nature; it is isolation, not co-operation, that needs to be explained." [38]; [this section is about property / in-common]; gets to households, is probably going to say things I disagree with. I don't think Jane Jacobs would agree with him about who has the advantage in relationship between town and country [42]; feudal relationships aren't contracts, but understandings [46]; religious/economic/artistic/political integration of the city

Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft: unity/detachment [52]; [again, these are ideal types, operating simultaneously]; commentary on preferences/values;  

#### Part 3

Ties two types of will (Wesenwille and Kürwille)---views of human nature and human action---to forms of social life. The types of will remind me of dual process models of cognition.

His view of community incorporates hierarchy at its core, primarily through the patriarchal family.

The section on law is interesting, because it's kind of about what kinds of relationship between people can exist.

[Would love to do an analysis of heteronormativity in Tönnies and Simmel. Both of them take the implications of hetero marriage pretty seriously and thoughtfully.]

now he's talking about ancient matriarchy [216-7];

> The more people come together as "mere people", or to put it another way, the more people of diverse kinds come together and recognise each other as rational human beings or as equals, the more probable and ultimately necessary it becomes that the universal order and system of Society be established among them. [217]

another fascinating point is how his discussion of Community and Society bleeds over into talking about trade/economy and the state/law.

it's really hard to view rational actors as anything other than a subset of human beings. in my view, following Tönnies, community provides the basis for a lot of nonrational action.

Gesellschaft is "revolutionary"; "decline of *life* and morals within the splendid edifice of the state" [218]. sense of loss here. this is a good summary passage. [irony, of course: those queer "pleasure-seekers" rebuild a kind of community on their own terms. again, the weirdness of the queer case is a useful thing to think with, but I think it's a great example of how the process of creating rational Society is "never complete" [218]]

community and natural law are often about *moral* claims, *against* rational Society, i.e. about "justice" [221]. we want to appeal to something bigger than ourselves as individuals.

custom and mores [223]. [interesting parallels to Durkheim?]. it's funny to read about the beginnings of agriculture after reading *Against the Grain* [224]; still, point about land as principle of diachronic and synchronic connection is well taken.

def commonwealth [228]. analogies to natural world are everywhere: this is like plants, this is like animals...

much like Anderson's global communities:

> The highest [fellowship] would ultimately be a commonwealth which must be imagined as including the whole of mankind. This was the ideal conception of the *Church* and the universal kingdom of the spiritual world. [234]

associations: voluntary groups [the web of group affiliations? duality of persons and groups? how specific is network theory to these kinds of ties?; think about Kate's reading on friendship... continue to come back to friendship as a way of life.]

love how influenced both Tönnies and Simmel are by the specter of socialism / communism [238-9].

fascinating connection of religion and public opinion, in the realm of ideas as an expression of will [239]; former is Community, latter is Society: "Religion therefore ranks above the commonwealth, and public opinion above the state." amusing section on faith and theory. public opinion, the press, and a world republic of sorts [242] (global Society, as it were, instead of global Community... does social media do this? or is it a weird hybrid of Community and Society?)

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kritik_der_%C3%B6ffentlichen_Meinung

kind of Heraclitean ending here:

> For civilisation's very existence is change, and this means both the development and the breakdown of existing forms. All change can only be grasped from the blending into each other of concepts in a constant state of flux. [243]

#### Conclusion

surprise, this was about the problem of social order.

State regards residues of Gemeinschaft with "contempt" [249] [reminds me of James Scott, seeing like a state! or Lefebvre, abstract space; the grid]. it continues to amuse me how studying Community winds up sneaking up on the State by the back door, as it were.

war of all against all (Hobbes) is actually consequence of Gesellschaft; think about how the Stranger is regarded in the Odyssey.

"In the place of the culture of the people we get the civilisation of the state." [250]

[I probably do need to bring Hobbes and Smith up here next time I'm home]

of course he's talking about religion and science [251]; as forms of knowledge relying on social categories (Durkheim), they aren't as in opposition as it might sound

the weird paradox of the gay community or the gay village is the formation of Community life in the context of urban Society, the big city / metropolis / *Großstädte* (note that Tönnies and Simmel are talking about the same thing!)

though Tönnies then says: big city + national capital = metropolis or international city [253] (What words did he use in German? Simmel's "metropolis" is Großstadt, which is Tönnies' "big city") [what about Saskia Sassen's *Global Cities*? that sounds like what Tönnies is describing here]

I need to find Durkheim's quotes on blood, soil, proximity too... but I think that's in Division of Labor, not Elementary Forms.

helpful table on 257. rich concepts here. connection certain types of social relations ('arrangements') to forms of social life

"... the power of Community, even in decline, is maintained into the era of Society and remains the true reality of social life." [258]

land and city, territory and "spatial principle"; invokes Das Kapital [259]

in a related vein, this dialogue is fascinating:

move back to your midwestern hometown!

https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/26/18255131/moving-midwest-cedar-rapids

... but only if you're cis, white, and straight!

https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/4/8/18297172/midwest-hometown-small-town-middle-america

what does home mean? what does community mean? who gets it, and where? in other words, who gets to belong?

> In both of their essays, Vance and Anderson seem shocked that they have made comfortable, fulfilling homes in small towns that provide more of a sense of belonging than the coastal cities where they once lived. Their writing idealizes Middle America as a place that encourages community. But it’s not shocking that Vance and Anderson fit into Middle American cities as cis white people.

THIS:

> In a recent tweet, Julie Rogers, a queer Christian and activist, observed, “Growing up in Texas and moving in evangelical spaces, I didn’t know much anxiety I carried in my body. I wasn’t aware of the depth of insecurity I felt in routine social interactions, always [self-conscious] about my clothes being too gay or my posture seeming too lezzy.” Rogers explains that just living in a place where others like her are visible has given her a confidence and lightness of existence she didn’t know was possible.

queer folks are more likely to put up with the struggles of existence and cities for need of the payoffs

I need to read that report on rural gays to take on their numbers.

[Can I teach my neglected social theorists class? Simmel, Tönnies, Tarde... Might teach Saussure too.]

### Context

how is Tönnies viewed as related to Weber, Simmel, and Durkheim?

Bond, Niall. 2012. “Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber.” Max Weber Studies 12(1):25–57.

Weber:

> But notwithstanding their importance, Tönnies' categories were for Weber no exception, and he too would restructure them according to the way he felt Tönniis 'should have meant it'. Thus, Weber's treatment of Tönnies' concepts in both his 1913 essay on categories of a sociology of understanding and Chapter 1 of Economy and Society could to be a 'hidden polemic' against Tönnies, while at the same owing essential stimuli to Tönnies. [Bond 2012]

description vs definition. different views of rationalization. (Tönnies didn't like the protestant ethic.) Tönnies is too teleological and value-laden for Weber. I should get a handle on Vergemeinschaftung and Vergesellschaftung.

Weber's terminology is confusing, and he changes it over time: Gemeinschaftshandeln -> soziales Handeln (social action); Vergemeinschaftung -> soziale Beziehung. new sense of Vergemeinschaftung that's closer to Tönnies. differences about values (Wertrationalität vs ethics of community) and creation of values.

Cahnman, Werner J. 1981. “Toennies and Weber: A Rejoinder.” European Journal of Sociology / Archives Européennes de Sociologie / Europäisches Archiv Für Soziologie 22(1):154–57.

Durkheim:

> But the further assumption by many authors that Gemeinschaft is identical with mechanical solidarity, and Gesellschaft with organic solidarity, is erroneous, even if that assumption is repeated in secondary, tertiary or whatever subsequent analysis. ...
> The Toenniesian type-constructs are 'pure', that is, notional concepts, even if in 'applied' sociology there is a tendency for Gesellschaft-like features to increase with the passage of time. Dürkheim speaks of ' real types ' that are observed, not of ' ideal types ' that serve as measuring devices, as does Toennies.

this is incredible: sassy reviews of each other's work from Durkheim and Tönnies. (incidentally, confirms that I might need to stick Division of Labor on my list...)
