## Tönnies 1887, *Community and Civil Society*

### introductions

[NB: editor Jose Harris is a woman, and I think her name is pronounced "Josie" not "José"]

This edition is less about sociology than about political theory, but I think that's okay if it's a good critical translation. It isn't the classic translation that would have informed 20c sociology.

All the talk of Hobbes is giving me flashbacks.

A lot of Tönnies is about different forms of property and law. [Do queer communities lack a political economy? Property, industrial base, etc...? Reminds me of the position of women in society, more than of people of color. Ani DiFranco: "Who says I like right angles?"]

tried to be analytical, not normative, but I sense skepticism from the editor.

Original English translation by Charles Loomis was the foundational one for US sociology

Maybe read Parsons' Note on Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft

relative pronouns are much more confusing in English than German, probs even more so than French

nice discussion of terminology and translation

### main text

[7] scientific thinking, calculating, measurement, identity, prototypes, names + numbers

I feel like the Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft is less clear cut than it sounds on [18]: certain things seem like they could be either depending on how you look at them or experience them. Queer communities, academic communities. (Also, no one talks about queer societies in English, anyway...)

Starts Gemeinschaft with (heteronormative) kinship [22] (but queer folk use the same language of kinship for reasons); note that he almost immediately talks about (gendered) power, inequality, authority [23-25]; power and protection [27];

blood -> place -> spirit = kinship -> neighborhood -> friend/comradeship; home -> village -> town [27-29] [think about this more] [why are gayborhoods so often called villages? maybe because queer worlds are small worlds]

> Wherever human beings are bound together in an organic fashion by their inclination and common consent, Community of one kind or another exists. [28]

how community can generate inequality [32]; language, will, understanding, and love -> "the fundamental laws of all community", *concord* [33-4]; [I hear echoes of Saussure in this section; the various editions of this book would've evolved in parallel with CLG]; ties to Anderson in the next.

> A whole town, or a village, or a nation, a tribe, a clan and finally a family can all in the same way been seen and understood as a particular type of guild or religious community. And vice versa---all these many different structures and formations are contained within the idea of the family and all proceed from it as the universal expression of the reality of Community. [36]

translator's footnote on Stadt vs Großstadt; also this: "And we forget that living together is a primal fact of nature; it is isolation, not co-operation, that needs to be explained." [38]; [this section is about property / in-common]; gets to households, is probably going to say things I disagree with. I don't think Jane Jacobs would agree with him about who has the advantage in relationship between town and country [42]; feudal relationships aren't contracts, but understandings [46]; religious/economic/artistic/political integration of the city

Gemeinschaft/Gesellschaft: unity/detachment [52]; [again, these are ideal types, operating simultaneously]; commentary on preferences/values;
