## Anderson 1983, *Imagined Communities*

Is "community" itself a concept bounded by language/nation? Anderson talks about the difficulty of finding a similarly warm and fuzzy word in French, and argues that English community has more in common with German Gemeinschaft than Latin communitas. I know that in France, *communautarisme* is a bad thing, and as something imported from the US. (I should read more about this, both in terms of ethnicity and in terms of sexuality.)

At the same time, one of his key examples is of national communities in Latin America. So, how does communidad *feel* in Spanish? My personal hunch is that it does exist as a meaningful word with positive connotations. But, I could be thinking primarily of latinx communities in the US, whose political understandings of community are inflected by English.
